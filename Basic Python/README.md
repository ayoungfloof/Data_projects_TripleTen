Basic Python - Project
Introduction
In this project, you will work with data from the entertainment industry. You will study a dataset with records on movies and shows. The research will focus on the "Golden Age" of television, which began in 1999 with the release of The Sopranos and is still ongoing.

The aim of this project is to investigate how the number of votes a title receives impacts its ratings. The assumption is that highly-rated shows (we will focus on TV shows, ignoring movies) released during the "Golden Age" of television also have the most votes.

Stages
Data on movies and shows is stored in the /datasets/movies_and_shows.csv file. There is no information about the quality of the data, so you will need to explore it before doing the analysis.

First, you'll evaluate the quality of the data and see whether its issues are significant. Then, during data preprocessing, you will try to account for the most critical problems.

Your project will consist of three stages:

Data overview
Data preprocessing
Data analysis

Conclusion
The research done confirms that highly-rated shows released during the "Golden Age" of television also have the most votes. While shows with score 4 have more votes than ones with scores 5 and 6, the top three (scores 7-9) have the largest number. The data studied represents around 94% of the original set, so we can be confident in our findings.
