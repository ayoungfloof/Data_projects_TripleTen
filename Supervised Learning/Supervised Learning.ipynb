    "# Customer Churn Prediction for Beta Bank\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Description:\n",
    "Beta Bank is facing customer churn as customers gradually leave the bank each month. To mitigate this issue, the bank wants to predict which customers are likely to leave. This project aims to build a machine learning classification model that identifies customers at risk of churning, helping Beta Bank take proactive measures to retain them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "The primary goal is to build a machine learning model with an F1 score of at least 0.59. The model will classify whether a customer will leave (churn) or stay based on their past behavior. Additionally, the AUC-ROC metric will be evaluated for comparison with the F1 score.\n",

    "The data file is Churn.csv, containing historical customer data with the following features:\n",

    "The dataset had a significant class imbalance, where 80% of customers had not exited (0), and only 20% had exited (1).<br>\n",

    "Model Performance<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Baseline Model: Without class imbalance adjustments, the initial decision tree achieved an F1 Score of 0.5177 and accuracy of 78.2%, indicating poor performance on the minority class.<br>\n",
    "Decision Tree Model (Class Weight): Adjusting for class imbalance improved the F1 score slightly to 0.5163 with accuracy rising to 79.2%.<br>\n",
    "Logistic Regression Model: Even with class weight adjustments, Logistic Regression struggled with complex patterns, yielding an F1 Score of 0.4970 and accuracy of 67.0%.<br>\n",
    "Random Forest Model (Class Weight): This model outperformed all others. After hyperparameter tuning, the best Random Forest model achieved an F1 Score of 0.6532 on the validation set and 0.6283 on the test set, with AUC-ROC of 0.8596.\n",
    "Key Insight: Random Forest emerged as the best model, balancing both precision and recall for predicting customer churn effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Importance<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Random Forest model's analysis:<br>\n",
    "Balance (account balance) and Age were the most significant predictors of churn.<br>\n",
    "Number of Products used, and whether the customer was an Active Member also played crucial roles.<br>\n",
    "Credit Score and Geography contributed less to the prediction.<br>\n",
    "Key Insight: Customers with higher balances and older ages showed varying churn probabilities. Active membership and product usage also influenced retention likelihood.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Sanity Check Insights<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge cases demonstrated that the model behaved logically:<br>\n",
    "Customers with high credit scores, zero balance, and high activity had low churn probabilities.<br>\n",
    "Customers with low credit scores, inactivity, and high balance were flagged as moderate risk.<br>\n",
    "The predictions aligned with expectations, highlighting the reliability of the trained Random Forest model.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Impact and Recommendations<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer Retention Focus: Target customers with high account balances who are inactive or under-engaged, as these factors increase churn risk.<br>\n",
    "Improve Engagement: Encourage customers to remain active and diversify their product usage (e.g., cross-sell products).<br>\n",
    "Monitor High-Risk Segments: Specifically, customers with low credit scores and high balances need closer attention to prevent churn.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Model Performance<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest model achieved the highest F1 score on the test set (0.6283) and demonstrated robust performance with AUC-ROC of 0.8596.<br>\n",
    "This performance meets the project's requirement of F1 â‰¥ 0.59."
