##  Forecasting Hourly Taxi Demand for Sweet Lift Taxi

### Description:
Sweet Lift Taxi, a ride-hailing service operating at major airports, seeks to enhance operational efficiency by accurately predicting the number of taxi orders in the upcoming hour. This project leverages historical order data to develop a robust time series forecasting model, enabling the company to proactively manage driver availability during peak demand periods. The key objective is to achieve a model that not only delivers high predictive accuracy but also meets the companyâ€™s benchmark of a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) below 48 on unseen data.

### Objective:
- Build and evaluate multiple forecasting models to predict hourly taxi orders.
- Explore a mix of traditional time series models (ARIMA) and modern machine learning techniques (Random Forest, LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost).
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Select the best model based on RMSE and prediction stability.
- Visualize and interpret forecast results to support decision-making for taxi deployment.

### Data Sources:
- The dataset is provided in /datasets/taxi.csv and contains:
    - Datetime: Timestamp of each record (resampled to hourly).
    - num_orders: Number of taxi orders received during each hour.
    
### Approach:

- Data Preparation:
    - Resampled raw data to hourly intervals.
    - Conducted exploratory time series analysis, including trend and seasonality decomposition.
    - Checked and corrected for non-stationarity using differencing techniques.
    - Created lag features, rolling averages, and time-based components (e.g., hour, day of week) to enhance machine learning performance.

- Model Development:
    - Trained and evaluated the following models:
    - Linear Regression
    - Random Forest Regressor
    - LightGBM Regressor
    - CatBoost Regressor
    - XGBoost Regressor
    - ARIMA
    
- Performance Evaluation:
    - Used Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the primary metric.
    - Compared actual vs predicted values on a 10% test set (chronologically split).
    - Visualized prediction quality using line plots to validate pattern matching.

- ## Final Conclusion: Sweet Lift Taxi Forecasting Project

In this project, a model was developed to forecast hourly taxi order demand for Sweet Lift Taxi using historical data. The primary objective was to build a model capable of predicting the number of orders for the next hour with an RMSE not exceeding 48.

### Data Preparation & Exploration
- The dataset contained timesamped order data, which was resampled to 1-hour intervals.
- Exploratory data analysis performed:
    - Visualizing overall trends
    - Rolling mean smoothing
    - Time Series decomposition
    - Stationarity testing using the ADF test
- Based on the stationarity check, it confirmed the series was non-stationary and addressed it using defferencing for ARIMA.

### Feature Engineering
To prepare the data for supergised learning models, these were created:
- Lag features to capture recent trends
- Rolling mean to smooth short-term fluctuations
- Time-based features such as hour and dayofweek

### Model Traning & Evaluation
Trained and compared several models using a chronological train-test split, with 10% of the data reserved as a test set.
- Linear Regression RMSE: 50.31 - Just slightly above target
- Random Forest RMSE: 45.11 - Solid and consistent.
- CatBoost RMSE: 43.71 - Nearly tied with LightGBM - very stable
- LightGBM RMSE: 43.66 - Best performance - efficient and fast. 
- XGBoost RMSE: 46.05 - Good, but slightly weaker than others. 
- ARIMA RMSE: 67.06 - Not a good fit here - likely underfitting

The best performing model was the LightGBM Regressor and when tuned with best parameters of:
- n_estimators=100
- max_depth=10
- num_leaves=31
- learning_rate=0.1
The model achieved an RMSE of 24.87, successfully meeting the project goal.

### Final Evaluation
The final model was validated on the test set and visualized against actual values. It effectively captured the overall demand patterns and seasonality in hourly taxi orders. While some extreme peaks were underpredicted (a common challenge in real-world forecasting), the model provides highly reliable estimates for most operating conditions.
