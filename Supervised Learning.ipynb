To mitigate this issue, the bank wants to predict which customers are likely to leave. This project aims to build a machine learning classification model that identifies customers at risk of churning, helping Beta Bank take proactive measures to retain them.\n\n### Objective:\nThe primary goal is to build a machine learning model with an F1 score of at least 0.59. The model will classify whether a customer will leave (churn) or stay based on their past behavior. Additionally, the AUC-ROC metric will be evaluated for comparison with the F1 score.\n\n### Data Source:\nThe data file is Churn.csv, containing historical customer data with the following features:\n\nRowNumber: Index of the data row.<br>\nCustomerId: Unique customer identifier.<br>\nSurname: Customer surname.<br>\nCreditScore: Credit score of the customer.<br>\nGeography: Country of residence.<br>\nGender: Gender of the customer.<br>\nAge: Customer's age.<br>\nTenure: Duration of account tenure (in years).<br>\nBalance: Customer's account balance.<br>\nNumOfProducts: Number of banking products used.<br>\nHasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card.<br>\nIsActiveMember: Whether the customer is active.<br>\nEstimatedSalary: Estimated annual salary.<br>\n\n### Approach:\nData Preparation:\n\nLoad and inspect the dataset.\nPreprocess features, ensuring categorical and numerical columns are appropriately handled.\nAddress class imbalance using techniques like class weighting, upsampling, and downsampling.\nModel Development:\n\nSplit the data into training, validation, and test sets.\nTrain and evaluate several classification models:\nDecision Tree Classifier\nLogistic Regression\nRandom Forest Classifier\nTune hyperparameters to improve model performance.\nCompare models based on F1 score and AUC-ROC metrics.\nModel Evaluation:\n\nEvaluate the final model using the test set.\nPerform a sanity check to ensure model consistency.\n\n### Tools Used\n\nimport pandas as pd                          \nfrom sklearn.model_selection import
